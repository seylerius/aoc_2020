#+TITLE: 2020 Advent of Code Solutions
#+AUTHOR: Sable Seyler

This year is my first attempt at the Advent of Code,
the delightful annual series of daily-released puzzles
which people compete to solve every year.

* Tools

+ Emacs (specifically [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/][Doom Emacs]])
+ [[https://clojure.org][Clojure]] (with [[https://docs.cider.mx/][CIDER]] and [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el][clj-refactor]])
+ [[https://github.com/engelberg/instaparse][Instaparse]] (combinators specifically)
+ [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] (with [[https://github.com/target/lorri][Lorri]] and [[https://direnv.net/][Direnv]])

I am solving in Clojure, a functional language atop the JVM,
because it is the language I'm most comfortable in.
I had previously been attempting this using regular expressions,
but the struggles with debugging them pushed me to
convert my earlier solutions to use Instaparse instead,
to allow for better readability and maintainability.
